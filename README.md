How to setup POSTGRES DB

If you have password error then do this 
1. Go to -> C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\data
2. Change files permissions
3. Open file pg_hba.conf and replace mothods with Trust 

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 trust
